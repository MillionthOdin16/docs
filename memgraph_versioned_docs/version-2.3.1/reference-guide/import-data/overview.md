There are two main methods for importing data into Memgraph:

- **[LOAD CSV Clause](/reference-guide/import-data/load-csv-clause.md)**: You
  can use the `LOAD CSV` Cypher clause to load data from CSV files.
- **[Importing Cypher queries](/reference-guide/import-data/cypherl.md)**: If
  your data is saved in the form of Cypher queries (we call this `.cypherl`
  format) then this is the right approach for you.
