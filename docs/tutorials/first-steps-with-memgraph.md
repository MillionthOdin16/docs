In this tutorial, you'll see the speed and power of Memgraph.  You'll use one of
our sandbox sites from **Memgraph Playground** to get the taste and feel of what
you can do with Memgraph. On top of that, you will learn how to run queries and
style your graphs.

The quickest way to see Memgraph in action is to run [one of our
sandboxes](https://playground.memgraph.com/sandboxes). Sandboxes are sites that
we have populated with data. They are a great place to start learning about
Memgraph. You can play around and test thing without fear of breaking something. 

Let's get started!

In this tutorial, you've learned how to use our sandbox sites to get your first
hands on experience with Memgraph. We hope that you had fun going through this
tutorial! You can continue playing in the sandbox, or even better [download and
