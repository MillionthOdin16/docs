## Create a new Memgraph instance

If you are using a 14-day free trial version of Memgraph Cloud, you can create one project that uses 2GB RAM. 

If you are using a paid version of Memgraph Cloud, you can create an unlimited number of projects.

To create a new project:

1. Click **Projects** in the left sidebar 
2. Click **Add new** button
3. In the popup, enter the project name, choose the cloud region, size and Memgraph version
4. Click **Next**
5. Add a password to your project. Youâ€™ll need it to connect to your Memgraph project. Keep in mind that we can't retrieve this password if you lose it. Click **Next**
6. Click **Go to project** to complete the project creation


## Pause, resume or delete a project

It is a good practice to pause projects you are not using. This way, you won't be charged for compute while the project is paused. However, you will continue to be charged for storage.

To pause a project:
1. Click **Projects** in the left sidebar 
2. Click on the project that you want to pause
3. In the **Actions** section click **Pause Project** 

To unpause a project:
1. Click **Projects** in the left sidebar 
2. Click on the project that you want to pause
3. In the **Actions** section click **Resume Project** 

When you no longer need a specific instance, you can delete it.Be careful with this option since you can't undo this action.

To delete a project:

1. Click **Projects** in the left sidebar 
2. Click on the project that you want to pause
3. In the **Actions** section, click **Delete Project** 
4. In the confirmation popup, click **Confirm** button.
