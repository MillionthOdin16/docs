Memgraph Cloud is a fully managed cloud service that allows you to create
instances of MemgraphDB from your browser. You can create projects with
instances that can use up to 32 GB of RAM to which you can connect using
Memgraph Lab, mgconsole or various drivers. All connectionsÂ¸use SSL
encryption with a self-signed certificate. 

Use Memgraph Cloud to stream data into Memgraph in real-time and run complex
graph algorithms and modules developed within the MAGE repository, such as
PageRank, Community detection or Betweenness centrality. You can also extend the
Cypher query language by developing your own procedures within query modules in
Memgraph Lab.

Instances can be easily paused to save resources, backed up and cloned by
creating snapshots. 

As a new user, try out Memgraph Cloud in a 14-days free trial and provide us
