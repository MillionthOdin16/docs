[Memgraph Cloud](https://cloud.memgraph.com/) is a fully managed cloud service
that allows you to create instances of MemgraphDB from your browser. You can
create projects with instances that can use up to 32 GB of RAM to which you can
connect using [Memgraph Lab](cloud-connect#connect-with-memgraph-lab),
[mgconsole](cloud-connect#connect-with-mgconsole) or various
[drivers](cloud-connect#connect-with-drivers). All connectionsÂ¸use SSL
encryption with a self-signed certificate. 

Use Memgraph Cloud to stream data into Memgraph in real-time and run complex
graph algorithms and modules developed within the [MAGE](/docs/mage) repository,
such as
[PageRank](/docs/mage/algorithms/traditional-graph-analytics/pagerank-algorithm),
[Community
detection](/docs/mage/algorithms/traditional-graph-analytics/community-detection-algorithm)
or [Betweenness
centrality](/docs/mage/algorithms/traditional-graph-analytics/betweenness-centrality-algorithm).
You can also extend the Cypher query language by developing your own procedures
within query modules in Memgraph Lab.

Instances can be easily paused to save resources, backed up and cloned by
creating snapshots. 

As a new user, try out Memgraph Cloud in a 14-days free trial and provide us

2. Log in with a Google account or create a Memgraph Cloud account.
3. Give your project a name and provide a password. 
4. Your project is up and running - connect to the instance, import data and
   start querying!
