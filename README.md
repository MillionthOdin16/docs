# Memgraph Docs

This repository contains the source files and various generators for the
Memgraph documentation available at
[docs.memgraph.com](https://docs.memgraph.com). Since we are writing our
technical documentation using markdown, it is also nicely rendered by GitHub as
you can see by following [this
link](https://github.com/memgraph/docs/blob/master/docs/overview.md).

## Contribute to the documentation

If you want to contribute to the documentation, please take a look at
[CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for details about the writing style and 
main ideas behind the documentation. In case you notice any problems or need additional
information, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/memgraph/docs/issues).
